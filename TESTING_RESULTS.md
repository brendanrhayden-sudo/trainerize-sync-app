```

## 🔧 Configuration Required

The application is fully functional but requires these environment variables:

### Required .env.local Configuration:
```bash
# Supabase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-project-url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-supabase-service-role-key

# Trainerize API Configuration
TRAINERIZE_API_BASE_URL=https://api.trainerize.com
TRAINERIZE_GROUP_ID=your-group-id
TRAINERIZE_API_TOKEN=your-api-token
```

## 🎯 Testing Options

### Option 1: Quick UI Testing (No Config Required)
```bash
# Start the server
npm run dev

# Visit in browser:
http://localhost:3000           # Dashboard
http://localhost:3000/exercises/manage    # Exercise management
http://localhost:3000/workouts            # Workout management
http://localhost:3000/workouts/discover   # Discovery tools
```

### Option 2: Basic Functionality Tests
```bash
# Run automated tests without requiring credentials
npm run test:basic
```

### Option 3: Full Integration Testing (Requires Configuration)
```bash
# After setting up .env.local:
npm run test:complete  # Complete system test
npm run test:sync      # Database sync test
```

### Option 4: Manual API Testing
```bash
# Test individual endpoints:
curl http://localhost:3000/api/exercises
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/workouts/discover
curl http://localhost:3000/api/backup

# Test with data (requires configuration):
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/exercises/add \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"exerciseData": {"name": "Test Exercise"}}'
```
